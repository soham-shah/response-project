						<p> Conceptually, people know that a lot of their information is online. However, I believe that they fail to realize how much there really is.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p> Without knowing what personal information is publically accessible online, people cannot make informed decisions about what data they would like others to have access to.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p> The following is a guide to finding information about yourself online and some resources on how you can get that information removed.</p>

					<section>
						<p>While there is a lot of data about you online, we want to pay special attention to see if we can find stuff you don't want others to see</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>According to <a href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/60-of-employers-are-peeking-into-candidates-social-media-profiles"> Career Builder's survey of hiring managers</a></p>	
						<p>60% of employers shared that they use social media sites to research potential employees.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Types of Data</h2>
						<p>Some things that are available about you include:</p>
						<ul>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Keywords</h2>
						<p>Try some keywords associated with yourself, like what school you went to, or where you work. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Close Associations</h2>
						<p> Try searching your name in association with some friends or family in order to narrow your search further </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2> Mispellings</h2>
						<p>If there is a different popular spelling of your name, try that in your search as well. For example, "Cong" and "Kong"</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Search Modifiers</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Remove terms</li>
								<ul><li>Use the "-" followed by any word to remove any results with that word from the search result. ex: "Johnny Depp -actor"</li></ul>
							<li>Force include</li>
								<ul><li>Use quotation marks around a work to force all results to have that word. ex "Bill "Boulder""</li></ul>
							<li>Site Specific Search</li>
								<ul><li>Use the "site:" modifier to search specific sites on the internet. ex: "Bill site:denverpost.com"</li>i</ul>

						<h2>Step 3: Social Networks</h2>
						<img src="https://cdn.makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/social_media.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>People know that everyone can see the information you post on social networks. But the question is, what information do you post?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Social Networks to check</h2>
						<p>Try searching for what data you can find about yourself on these platforms</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Facebook</li>
							<li>Instagram</li>
							<li>Pinterest</li>
							<li>Twitter</li>
							<li>Flickr</li>
							<li>Youtube</li>
							<li>LinkedIn</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>While there are many social networks, it becomes tedious to check them all</p>
						<p>There are websites which will allow others to search across all social media platforms and provide that information to users Let's see what they turn up</p>
						<p>This will allow us to find the accounts you made and then forgot about</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Social Media Aggregators</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://socialmention.com/">Social Mention</a></h2>
						<p>This will allow you to find and track what has been said about you by others online</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://www.social-searcher.com">Social Searcher</a></h2>
						<p>This will allow you to find and track what has been said about you by others online</p>

						<h2>Step 4: People Search Engines</h2>
						<img src="http://www.nextadvisor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bigstock-People-search-23876987-1.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There are search engines online designed to specifically search for what public records on you are available. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://www.whowhere.com/">Who Where</a></h2>
						<p>Like an online yellowpages, this allows you to find addresses and phone numbers of people</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://birth-records.mooseroots.com/">Birth Records</a></h2>
						<p>See if your birth record is publically accessible</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://pipl.com/">Pipl</a></h2>
						<p>The scariest people search I've found. It finds employment, usernames, dates of birth, news articles, and online posts</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://www.spokeo.com">Spokeo</a></h2>
						<p>Can Find: age, address, relatives, locations where you have lived.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact</a></h2>
						<p>Provide them an email address and this service will fill in the rest of the information on what it knows for everyone in your address book. Great for business users, but also quite scary!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://www.intelius.com">Intelius</a></h2>
						<p>Intelius provides phone numbers, addresses, names of relatives, and past employment data</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- specialized databases -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Step 5: Special Databases</h2>
						<img src="https://socialads.guru/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/db14.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Often there are specialized databases that don't show up in traditional search results that we need to check</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>News</h2>
						<p>Make sure to check the <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> results seperately. The Search modifier information still apples</p>
						<p>Often news websites are not publically searchable. Try searching the records of your local news websites to see what they have about you. You may not even know that you were in the news!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Public Records</h2>
						<p>Cities sometimes keep records about their citizens publically accessible. Mouse around on your city website and see if you can find out what information about you they're sharing to the world</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://voterrecords.com">Voter Records</a></h2>
						<p>Given a name, this will list your party affiliation, address, and where you are registered to vote</p>
					</section>

						<h2>Reverse image search</h2>
						<p>Once you grabbed a photo of yourself with a decently high resolution, run it through a reverse image search engine to see what it can find.</p>
						<p>Some engines are</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.tineye.com">Tineye</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.images.google.com">Google Images</a></li>
