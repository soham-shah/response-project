						<p> Conceptually, people know that a lot of their information is online. However, I believe that they don't know specifics, which makes it hard for them to understand why it's such a big issue.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p> Without knowing what personal information of theirs is publically accessible online, people cannot make informed decisions about what data they would like others to have access to.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>According to <a href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/60-of-employers-are-peeking-into-candidates-social-media-profiles"> Career Builder's survey of hiring managers</a></p>	
						<p>60% of employers shared that they use social media sites to research potential employees. This is just one example of </p>

						<p> The following is a guide to finding information about yourself online and some resources on how you can get that information removed.</p>
						<p>The Goal behind the guide is to help inform you about what people online can find out about you, and provide some resources on how to get that taken down.</p>

						</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>While there is a lot of data about you online, you should pay special attention to see if there is anything that you don't want others to see</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Types of Data</h2>
						<p>Some things that are available about you include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Your address</li>
							<li>Your phone number</li>
							<li>People you're associated with</li>
							<li>News coverage about you</li>
							<li>Arrest records</li>
							<li>Unflattering images of you</li>
							<li>And so on...</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Goal</h2>
						<p>The Goal behind this website is to provide a resource to help you locate that information and some resources on how to get it taken down</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>As you're going through each of the steps outlined later, make sure that you're tracking what you find and saving all the links so you can go back later to remove them.</p>

						</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p> Each search engine will have different search results so try entering your name in the following and see what pops up.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></li>

						<h2>Step 2: Narrow Your search</h2>
						<img src="https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ8/QC1F/GYUQTJ9M/FZ8QC1FGYUQTJ9M.MEDIUM.jpg" alt="Magnifying Glass" width="620"  height="495">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Goal</h2>
						<p>The goal of this is to start filtering our noise and unnecessary results to really find some important information and where it's hidden. There are many paid companies that do this automatically, but we want to figure out what people can surface for free if they use the right query.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Keywords</h2>
						<p>Try some keywords associated with yourself, like what school you went to, the company you work at, passions of yours, the city you live in, etc. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Close Associations</h2>
						<p> Try searching your name in association with some friends or family in order to narrow your search further </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2> Misspellings</h2>
						<p>If there is a different popular spelling of your name, try that in your search as well. For example, "Cong" and "Kong"</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Nicknames</h2>
						<p>If you go by a nickname, make sure to try both combinations of your name</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Maiden Name</h2>
						<p>Same as above, try both your married name and your maiden name.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Search Modifiers</h3>
						<p>Search modifiers are powerful ways of narrowing your search results by structuring your search in a specific way</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Remove terms</li>
								<ul><li>Use the "-" followed by any word to remove any results with that word from the search result. ex: "Johnny Depp -actor"</li></ul>
							<li>Force include</li>
								<ul><li>Use quotation marks around a work to force all results to have that word. ex "Bill "Boulder""</li></ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Search Modifiers Continued</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Site Specific Search</li>
								<ul><li>Use the "site:" modifier to search specific sites on the internet. ex: "Bill site:colorado.edu"</li></ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
						<p>If the search modifiers are too confusing, try using the advanced search page for each search engine to narrow down your search</p>

						<h2>Step 3: Social Networks</h2>
						<img src="https://cdn.makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/social_media.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Goal</h2>
						<p>People know that everyone can see the information you post on social networks. But the question is, what information do you post, and what does that say about you?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Social Networks to check</h3>
						<p>Try searching for what data you can find about yourself on these platforms. Use private browsing or a friends account to see what's visible when others look at your profile</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Facebook</li>
							<li>Instagram</li>
							<li>Pinterest</li>
							<li>Twitter</li>
							<li>Flickr</li>
							<li>Youtube</li>
							<li>LinkedIn</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>While there are many social networks, it becomes tedious to check them all</p>
						<p>There are websites which will allow others to search across all social media platforms and provide that information to users Let's see what they turn up</p>
						<p>This will allow us to find the accounts you made and then forgot about</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Social Media Aggregators</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://socialmention.com/">Social Mention</a></h2>
						<p>This will allow you to find and track what has been said about you by others online</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://www.social-searcher.com">Social Searcher</a></h2>
						<p>This also allows you to find and track what has been said about you by others online</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There are search engines online designed to specifically search for what public records on you are available. Let's see what they can find.</p>
						<p>Tip: try using a couple which sound interesting. No need to try them all</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://www.whowhere.com/">Who Where</a></h2>
						<p>Like an online yellow pages, this allows you to find addresses and phone numbers of people</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://pipl.com/">Pipl</a></h2>
						<p>One of the scariest people search I've found. It finds employment, usernames, dates of birth, news articles, and online posts</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://www.spokeo.com">Spokeo</a></h2>
						<p>Can Find: age, address, relatives, locations where you have lived.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact</a></h2>
						<p>Provide them an email address, and this service will fill in the rest of the information on what it knows for everyone in your address book. Great for business users, but also quite scary!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://www.intelius.com">Intelius</a></h2>
						<p>Intelius provides phone numbers, addresses, names of relatives, and past employment data</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- specialized databases -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Step 5: Special Databases</h2>
						<img src="https://socialads.guru/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/db14.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Often there are specialized databases that don't show up in traditional search results that we need to check</p>
						<p>While this list is not comprehensive, it gives an idea of things you can look for</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>News</h2>
						<p>Make sure to check the <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> results separately. <a href="#/6/4"> The Search modifier information still apples</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>News Continued</h2>
						<p>Often times local news records are not publically searchable</p>
						<p>Try a search query like "John Doe site:denverpost.com" in order to search their web facing archive</p>
						<p>Also try going to the local newspaper's website directly and running some searches there to see what you can unearth.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Public Records</h2>
						<p>Cities sometimes keep records about their citizens publically accessible. Mouse around on your city website and see if you can find out what information about you they're sharing to the world</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://voterrecords.com">Voter Records</a></h2>
						<p>Given a name, this will list your party affiliation, address, and where you are registered to vote</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://birth-records.mooseroots.com/">Birth Records</a></h2>
						<p>See if your birth record is publically accessible</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><a href="http://www.familywatchdog.us/ShowNameList.asp">Family Watchdog</a></h2>
						<p>Gives the names and locations of all known sex offenders, gives you pictures and profiles. If you're on here, you already know, but it is interesting to see what data on other people is available. Think about whether this is something you support or not. </p>

						<h2>Reverse image search</h2>
						<p>Once you grabbed a photo of yourself with a decently high resolution, run it through a reverse image search engine to see what it can find.</p>
						<p>Some engines are</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.tineye.com">Tineye</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://images.google.com">Google Images</a></li>

						<p>Now, using everything that we've found, go through and think about what you would like taken off the internet and what you don't mind leaving online.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>If you live in the EU</h2>
						<p>Great! You're protected under the Right to be Forgotten. You can contact Google and the other search engines, and ask for your private information to be removed from their search results. </p>
						<p>Read the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_en.pdf"> factsheet on the right to be forgotten ruling </a> to understand your rights.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>If you live in the US</h2>
						<p>There is no single overarching federal law giving citizens something similar to the right to be forgotten. </p>
						<p>Read <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-502-0467"> here </a> for more information </p>
						<p>Read on for tips you can follow to make it harder to find your information</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Other things you can do</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Clean up your social media profiles.</li>
								<ul><li>While your photos may already be out there on the internet, you can certainly make them harder to find by removing all the old stuff from your public social media profiles.</li></ul>
							<li>Delete old and unused social media accounts</li>
							<li>Edit your privacy settings on the websites you turned up in your previous searches</li>
							<li>Contact each website that's listed on your search results individually and ask for your information to be removed.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Fooling Search Algorithms</h3>
						<p>Search Engine algorithms operate using something called Page Rank which tries to surface the latest and most relevant content</p>
						<p>You can trick these algorithms by creating new fresh content that you've chosen to represent you</p>
						<p> See this <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-porn-star-sasha-grey-removed-1000s-of-cocks-from-internet-search-results"> article </a> on how Pornstar Sasha Grey cleaned up her social media presence to give you a good idea on how to start.
