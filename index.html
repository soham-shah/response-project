					<section>
						<h2>Keywords</h2>
						<p>Try some keywords associated with yourself, like what school you went to, or where you work. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Close Associations</h2>
						<p> Try searching your name in association with some friends or family in order to narrow your search further </p>
					</section>
					<section>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Search Modifiers</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Remove terms</li>
								<ul><li>Use the "-" followed by any word to remove any results with that word from the search result. ex: "Johnny Depp -actor"</li></ul>
							<li>Force include</li>
								<ul><li>Use quotation marks around a work to force all results to have that word. ex "Bill "Boulder""</li></ul>
							<li>Site Specific Search</li>
								<ul><li>Use the "site:" modifier to search specific sites on the internet. ex: "Bill site:denverpost.com"</li>i</ul>
